> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). Puppeteer runs [headless](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

###### What can I do?

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

- Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
- Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
- Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
- Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
- Capture a [timeline trace](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference) of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
- Test Chrome Extensions.

# Licensing

If you want to use browserless to build commercial sites, applications, or in a continuous-integration system that's closed-source then you'll need to purchase a commercial license. This allows you to keep your software proprietary whilst still using browserless. [You can purchase a commercial license here](https://www.browserless.io/sign-up?type=commercial). A commercial license grants you:

- Priority support on issues and features.
- On-premise running as well as running on public cloud providers for commercial/CI purposes for proprietary systems.
- Ability to modify the source (forking) for your own purposes.

Not only does it grant you a license to run such a critical piece of infrastructure, but you are also supporting further innovation in this space and our ability to contribute to it!

If you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the GNU GPL license v3, you may use browserless under the terms of the GPLv3. You can read more about this license [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html).
